                        Greek writers Aristophanes and Homer both mention
                        hairdressing in their writings. In Africa, it was
                        believed in some cultures that a person's spirit
                        occupied his or her hair, giving hairdressers high
                        status within these communities. The status of
                        hairdressing encouraged many to develop their skills,
                        and close relationships were built between hairdressers
                        and their clients. Hours would be spent washing,
                        combing, oiling, styling and ornamenting their hair. Men
                        would work specifically on men, and women on other
                        women. Before a master hairdresser died, they would give
                        their combs and tools to a chosen successor during a
                        special ceremony. <br /><br />
                        In ancient Egypt, hairdressers had specially decorated
                        cases to hold their tools, including lotions, scissors
                        and styling materials. Barbers also worked as
                        hairdressers, and wealthy men often had personal barbers
                        within their home. With the standard of wig wearing
                        within the culture, wigmakers were also trained as
                        hairdressers. In ancient Rome and Greece household
                        slaves and servants took on the role of hairdressers,
                        including dyeing and shaving. Men who did not have their
                        own private hair or shaving services would visit the
                        local barbershop. Women had their hair maintained and
                        groomed at their homes. Historical documentation is
                        lacking regarding hairstylists from the 5th century
                        until the 14th century. Hair care service grew in demand
                        after a papal decree in 1092 demanded that all Roman
                        Catholic clergymen remove their facial hair.

                    <h3>
                        The first appearance of the word "hairdresser" is in
                        17th century Europe, and hairdressing was considered a
                        profession.

                            >Hair fashion of the period suggested that wealthy
                            women wear large, complex and heavily adorned
                            hairstyles, which would be maintained by their
                            personal maids and other people, who would spend
                            hours dressing the woman's hair. </span
                        >A wealthy man's hair would often be maintained by a
                        valet. It was in France where men began styling women's
                        hair for the first time, and many of the notable
                        hairdressers of the time were men, a trend that would
                        continue into contemporary times. The first famous male
                        hairdresser was Champagne, who was born in Southern
                        France. Upon moving to Paris, he opened his own hair
                        salon and dressed the hair of wealthy Parisian women
                        until his death in 1658. <br /><br />
                        Women's hair grew taller in style during the 17th
                        century, popularized by the hairdresser Madame Martin.
                        The hairstyle, "the tower," was the trend with wealthy
                        English and American women, who relied on hairdressers
                        to style their hair as tall as possible. Tall piles of
                        curls were pomaded, powdered and decorated with ribbons,
                        flowers, lace, feathers and jewelry. The profession of
                        hairdressing was launched as a genuine profession when
                        Legros de Rumigny was declared the first official
                        hairdresser of the French court. In 1765 de Rumigny
                        published his book Art de la Coiffure des Dames, which
                        discussed hairdressing and included pictures of
                        hairstyles designed by him. The book was a best seller
                        amongst Frenchwomen, and four years later de Rumigny
                        opened a school for hairdressers: Academie de Coiffure.
                        At the school he taught men and women to cut hair and
                        create his special hair designs.
                        <br /><br />
                        By 1777, approximately 1,200 hairdressers were working
                        in Paris. During this time, barbers formed unions, and
                        demanded that hairdressers do the same. Wigmakers also
                        demanded that hairdressers cease taking away from their
                        trade, and hairdressers responded that their roles were
                        not the same, hairdressing was a service, and wigmakers
                        made and sold a product. de Rumigny died in 1770 and
                        other hairdressers gained in popularity, specifically
                        three Frenchmen: Frederic, Larseueur, and Léonard.
                        Leonard and Larseueur were the stylists for Marie
                        Antoinette. Leonard was her favorite, and developed many
                        hairstyles that became fashion trends within wealthy
                        Parisian circles, including the loge d'opera, which
                        towered five feet over the wearer's head. During the
                        French Revolution he escaped the country hours before he
                        was to be arrested, alongside the king, queen, and other
                        clients. He emigrated to Russia, where he worked as the
                        premier hairdresser for Russian nobility.

                        Parisian hairdressers continued to develop influential
                        styles during the early 19th century.

                            hairdressers style their hair from within their own
                            homes, a trend seen in wealthy international
                            communities. </span
                        >Hairdressing was primarily a service affordable only to
                        those wealthy enough to hire professionals or to pay for
                        servants to care for their hair. In the United States,
                        Marie Laveau was one of the most famous hairdressers of
                        the period. Laveau, located in New Orleans, began
                        working as a hairdresser in the early 1820s, maintaining
                        the hair of wealthy women of the city. She was a voodoo
                        practitioner, called the "Voodoo Queen of New Orleans,"
                        and she used her connections to wealthy women to support
                        her religious practice. She provided "help" to women who
                        needed it for money, gifts and other favors.
                        <br /><br />
                        French hairdresser Marcel Grateau developed the "Marcel
                        wave" in the late part of the century. His wave required
                        the use of a special hot hair iron and needed to be done
                        by an experienced hairdresser. Fashionable women asked
                        to have their hair "marceled." During this period,
                        hairdressers began opening salons in cities and towns,
                        led by Martha Matilda Harper, who developed one of the
                        first retail chains of hair salons, the Harper Method.
                        <br /><br />
                        Beauty salons became popularized during the 20th
                        century, alongside men's barbershops. These spaces
                        served as social spaces, allowing women to socialize
                        while having their hair done and other services such as
                        facials. Wealthy women still had hairdressers visit
                        their home, but, the majority of women visited salons
                        for services, including high-end salons such as
                        Elizabeth Arden's Red Door Salon.
                        <br /><br />
                        Major advancements in hairdressing tools took place
                        during this period. Electricity led to the development
                        of permanent wave machines and hair dryers. These tools
                        allowed hairdressers to promote visits to their salons,
                        over limited service in-home visits. New coloring
                        processes were developed, including those by Eugene
                        Schueller in Paris, which allowed hairdressers to
                        perform complicated styling techniques. After World War
                        I, the bob cut and the shingle bob became popular,
                        alongside other short haircuts. In the 1930s complicated
                        styles came back into fashion, alongside the return of
                        the Marcel wave. Hairdressing was one of the few
                        acceptable professions during this time for women,
                        alongside teaching, nursing and clerical work.

                                A Dutch hairstylist gives a woman the "Coup
                                Sixty-One" hairstyle. After completing the look,
                                he then shows that his styling can withstand the
                                elements, with a watering can demonstration.

                            >Occupationally, hairdressing is expected to grow
                            faster than the average for all other occupations,
                            at 20%. A state license is required for hairdressers
                            to practice, with qualifications varying from state
                            to state.</span
                        >
                        Generally a person interested in hairdressing must have
                        a high school diploma or GED, be at least 16 years of
                        age, and have graduated from a state-licensed barber or
                        cosmetology school. Full-time programs often last 9
                        months or more, leading to an associate degree. After
                        students graduate from a program, they take a state
                        licensing exam, which often consists of a written test,
                        and a practical test of styling or an oral exam.
                        Hairdressers must pay for licenses, and occasionally
                        licenses must be renewed. Some states allow hairdressers
                        to work without obtaining a new license, while others
                        require a new license. About 44% of hairdressers are
                        self-employed, often putting in 40-hour work weeks, and
                        even longer among the self-employed. In 2008, 29% of
                        hairstylists worked part-time, and 14% had variable
                        schedules. As of 2008, people working as hairdressers
                        totaled about 630,700, with a projected increase to
                        757,700 by 2018.
